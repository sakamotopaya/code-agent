- **Integrated Workflow**: Working exclusively in VS Code
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Prefer graphical interface
- **Rich Media**: Need to view images, diagrams, or rich text
- **IntelliSense Dependency**: Rely heavily on code completion

#### Example Workflows

```
1. Interactive Code Review
   - Open files in VS Code
   - Use Roo panel for analysis
   - Apply changes with visual feedback
   - Use VS Code Git integration

2. Educational/Learning
   - Visual code exploration
   - Interactive explanations
   - Integrated debugging
   - Rich text documentation
```

### When to Choose CLI

#### Ideal Scenarios

- **Automation**: Need scriptable operations
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated code analysis/generation
- **Cross-Platform**: Work across different editors/environments
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files/projects
- **Remote Development**: SSH or cloud-based development
- **Performance Critical**: Need fast, lightweight operations

#### Example Workflows

```bash
# 1. Automated Code Review Pipeline
roo-cli --batch "Analyze all Python files" --format json | \
  jq '.issues[]' | \
  while read issue; do
    echo "Issue: $issue" >> review.md
  done

# 2. CI/CD Integration
# .github/workflows/code-analysis.yml
- name: Analyze Code
  run: |
    roo-cli --batch "Security audit" --format json > security.json
    roo-cli --batch "Performance analysis" --format json > performance.json

# 3. Multi-Project Automation
for project in projects/*/; do
  cd "$project"
  roo-cli --batch "Generate documentation" --output docs/
  cd ..
done
```

## Migration Decision Matrix

### Choose VS Code Extension If

| Criteria                        | Weight | Reason                          |
| ------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Primary Editor is VS Code**   | High   | Native integration advantages   |
| **Visual Interface Preference** | High   | Rich UI and syntax highlighting |
| **Occasional AI Usage**         | Medium | Easier for infrequent usage     |
| **Team uses VS Code**           | Medium | Consistent tooling              |
| **Learning/Educational Use**    | Medium | Visual feedback helps learning  |

### Choose CLI If

| Criteria                     | Weight | Reason                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Automation Requirements**  | High   | Scriptability is essential   |
| **CI/CD Integration**        | High   | Native automation support    |
| **Multi-Editor Environment** | High   | Editor agnostic              |
| **Performance Critical**     | High   | Lower resource usage         |
| **Remote Development**       | High   | Better SSH/cloud support     |
| **Batch Processing**         | High   | Designed for bulk operations |

## Hybrid Approach

### Using Both Tools

Many teams successfully use both tools for different scenarios:

```bash
# Development workflow combination
# 1. Use VS Code extension for interactive development
code .
# Interactive development with Roo panel

# 2. Use CLI for automation and CI/CD
roo-cli --batch "Analyze recent changes" --format json > analysis.json

# 3. Use CLI for batch operations
roo-cli --batch "Update documentation for all modules" --output docs/

# 4. Use VS Code for reviewing CLI results
code analysis.json
code docs/
```

### Configuration Synchronization

Keep configurations in sync between both tools:

```bash
# Export VS Code settings for CLI reference
code --list-extensions > vscode-extensions.txt

# Generate CLI config based on VS Code settings
roo-cli config --import-vscode ~/.vscode/settings.json

# Keep both configs in version control
git add .vscode/settings.json .roo-cli.json
```

## Future Considerations

### Roadmap Alignment

| Feature                      | VS Code Extension | CLI           | Timeline       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Enhanced MCP Support**     | Planned           | ✅ Available  | CLI leads      |
| **Better Session Sync**      | Planned           | ✅ Available  | CLI leads      |
| **Advanced Automation**      | Limited roadmap   | ✅ Continuous | CLI focus      |
| **Visual Improvements**      | ✅ Continuous     | Limited scope | VS Code focus  |
| **Performance Optimization** | Ongoing           | ✅ Continuous | Both improving |

### Technology Evolution

- **WebAssembly Integration**: May benefit VS Code extension more
- **Language Server Protocol**: May bridge the gap between tools
- **Container/Cloud Native**: CLI has natural advantages
- **AI Model Evolution**: Both platforms will benefit equally

## Conclusion

Both the VS Code extension and CLI serve different but sometimes overlapping needs:

- **VS Code Extension**: Best for interactive, visual development within VS Code
- **CLI**: Best for automation, CI/CD, cross-platform, and performance-critical use cases

The choice depends on your specific workflow, team requirements, and technical constraints. Many successful teams use both tools complementarily, leveraging each tool's strengths for appropriate scenarios.
