# CLI Build Debugging and Fix Plan

## Problem Statement

The nexe build process claims to create the executable successfully but the file doesn't exist at the expected location, causing the build to fail.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Potential Issues:

1. **Path Resolution**: nexe might be interpreting the output path differently
2. **Working Directory**: nexe might be using a different working directory context
3. **Nexe Configuration**: The nexe config might need adjustments for the new path structure
4. **Timing Issue**: File might be created but not immediately available for the existence check

### Investigation Steps:

#### 1. Enhanced Debugging

- Add detailed path logging before and after nexe compilation
- Log the actual working directory nexe is using
- Add file system checks in multiple locations to see where the file is actually created

#### 2. Path Resolution Fix

- Ensure nexe receives absolute paths rather than relative paths
- Verify the output directory creation happens before nexe compilation
- Add path validation and normalization

#### 3. Nexe Configuration Review

- Review nexe documentation for output path handling
- Check if nexe has specific requirements for output directory structure
- Verify nexe version compatibility

## Implementation Plan

### Story 1: Enhanced Build Debugging

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2 points

**Tasks**:

1. Add comprehensive logging to `scripts/build-nexe.js`:

    - Log input/output paths (absolute)
    - Log working directory
    - Log directory existence before/after nexe compilation
    - Add file system scanning to find where nexe actually creates files

2. Add path validation:
    - Ensure all paths are absolute
    - Verify directory creation
    - Add pre-flight checks

### Story 2: Path Resolution Fix

**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 3 points

**Tasks**:

1. Convert all paths to absolute paths in build scripts
2. Ensure proper directory creation timing
3. Add fallback directory scanning if primary location fails
4. Add retry logic for file existence checks

### Story 3: Nexe Configuration Optimization

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 3 points

**Tasks**:

1. Review and optimize nexe configuration in `scripts/build-nexe.js`
2. Test alternative nexe output strategies
3. Consider alternative build tools if nexe continues to have issues
4. Add comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Expected Outcomes

- CLI executables successfully build to `apps/` directory
- Build process provides clear error messages when failures occur
- Reliable cross-platform executable generation

## Testing Strategy

1. Test on local macOS development environment
2. Verify path resolution works on all target platforms
3. Test in CI/CD environment to ensure consistency
4. Validate executables actually run after creation

## Alternative Solutions (if nexe continues to fail)

1. Switch to Node.js SEA (Single Executable Applications)
2. Use pkg with updated configuration
3. Use other tools like boxed-node or caxa
