# Delete Tasks Tool - Product Stories

## Epic: Task Management - Delete Tasks Tool

### Overview

Implement a `delete_tasks` tool that allows LLMs to permanently delete tasks from the agent's storage system. The tool should follow the same pattern as `list_tasks` and provide safe, user-confirmed deletion of multiple tasks.
