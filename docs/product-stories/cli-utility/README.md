## Labels
All stories are labeled with `cli-utility` for easy tracking and filtering. Additional phase-specific and feature-specific labels are included for better organization.

## Dependencies
Stories should generally be implemented in phase order, with some stories having specific dependencies noted in their individual documents. Key dependency chains:

- Stories 2-4 depend on Story 1 (interfaces)
- Stories 5-8 depend on Stories 1-4 (core abstraction)
- Stories 10-12 depend on Story 9 (tool compatibility)
- Stories 13-16 depend on Story 12 (output formatting)
- Stories 17-20 depend on Story 16 (error handling)

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Phase-based Development**: Implement stories in phase order to ensure proper foundation
2. **Testing Strategy**: Each story should include comprehensive tests as defined in Story 17
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are implemented (Story 18)
4. **Performance Considerations**: Keep Story 20 requirements in mind during implementation
5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling patterns from Story 16 throughout

## Getting Started

1. Begin with Phase 1 stories to establish the core abstraction layer
2. Review the [CLI Implementation Overview](cli-utility-implementation.md) for architectural context
3. Follow the individual story documents for detailed implementation guidance
4. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before marking stories as complete
