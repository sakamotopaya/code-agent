we are ready to work on issue #18 (docs/product-stories/cli-utility/story-18-update-documentation.md) in repo https://github.com/sakamotopaya/code-agent.
follow the normal git flow. create a new local branch for the story.
code the tasks and unit tests that prove the task are complete.
if you need information about prior stories, you can find them locally here docs/product-stories/cli-utility
we often get rejected trying to push our changes. make sure and run a build and lint prior to trying to push
when you are finished with the code and tests, update the issue with a new comment describing your work and then
push your branch and create a pull request for this branch against main
you should use regular git command but it might be best to create the PR using the mcp server

We need to resume work on issue #17 (docs/product-stories/cli-utility/story-17-comprehensive-cli-testing.md) in repo https://github.com/sakamotopaya/code-agent.
