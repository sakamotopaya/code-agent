### Validation Scenarios

#### CLI Validation

```bash
# Test list_modes tool
./cli-tool --task "list the modes available to you"

# Test custom modes
./cli-tool --task "list modes containing 'debug'"

# Test tool chaining
./cli-tool --task "list modes then switch to architect mode"
```

#### API Validation

```bash
# Test via SSE streaming
./test-api.js --stream "list the modes available to you"

# Test tool execution events
curl -X POST /execute/stream -d '{"task": "list modes"}'

# Test error handling
./test-api.js --stream "use invalid tool"
```
