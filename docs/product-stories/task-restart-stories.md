# Task Restart Feature - Product Stories

## Epic: Cross-Context Task Restart Functionality

**As a developer using the Code Agent across different interfaces (VSCode Extension, CLI, API), I want to be able to restart and continue tasks regardless of where they were originally created, so that I can maintain workflow continuity and pick up where I left off.**

## Story 1: API Client Task Restart Parameter

**As an API client user, I want to specify a task ID to restart an existing task, so that I can continue a previous conversation.**

### Acceptance Criteria
