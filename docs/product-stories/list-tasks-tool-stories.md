# List Tasks Tool - Product Stories

## Epic: Implement List Tasks Tool

**As a** developer using the code agent  
**I want** to be able to list and browse all stored tasks  
**So that** I can manage my task history, review past work, and understand system usage patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

- Tool follows the same pattern as existing `list_modes` tool
- Returns basic task metadata: ID, creation date, status, title, mode, and token usage
- Supports filtering similar to other list tools
- Works across all execution contexts (VSCode, CLI, API)
- Handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback

## Story 1: Core Task Discovery and Metadata Extraction

**As a** system  
**I want** to scan the storage directory and extract task metadata  
**So that** I can provide comprehensive task information to users

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `src/core/tools/listTasksTool.ts` with main tool function
- [ ] Implement `getTasksFromStorage()` function to scan task directories
- [ ] Implement `extractTaskMetadata()` function to parse JSON files
- [ ] Create task status determination logic
- [ ] Add error handling for corrupted or missing files
- [ ] Implement token usage calculation from conversation history
- [ ] Add workspace directory extraction from environment details

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully scans storage/tasks directory for UUID folders
- [ ] Extracts creation date from first message timestamp
- [ ] Determines task title from first user message (truncated appropriately)
- [ ] Calculates total token usage and cost from API conversation history
- [ ] Determines task status (active, completed, failed, abandoned, unknown)
- [ ] Extracts current/last mode information from conversation
- [ ] Handles missing or corrupted JSON files gracefully
- [ ] Returns structured TaskInfo objects

### Technical Notes

```typescript
interface TaskInfo {
	id: string
	createdAt: Date
	lastActivity: Date
	status: "active" | "completed" | "failed" | "abandoned" | "unknown"
	title: string
	mode: {
		current?: string
		name?: string
	}
	tokenUsage: {
		total: number
		cost: number
	}
	messageCount: number
	duration?: number
	workspaceDir?: string
}
```

- [ ] Add cost formatting with currency
- [ ] Handle empty results gracefully

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tasks are displayed in clear, readable format
- [ ] Summary shows total tasks and breakdown by status
- [ ] Filter parameter searches across title, ID, mode, and status

- [ ] Token usage and cost are clearly displayed
- [ ] Empty results show helpful message
- [ ] Long task titles are truncated appropriately

## Story 4: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**As a** system  
**I want** to handle various error conditions gracefully  
**So that** the tool remains reliable even with corrupted or missing data

### Tasks

- [ ] Handle missing storage directory (create or use fallback)
- [ ] Handle permission errors with helpful messages
- [ ] Handle corrupted JSON files (skip with warning)
- [ ] Handle missing required JSON fields (use defaults)
- [ ] Handle invalid timestamp formats
- [ ] Handle large numbers of tasks (performance optimization)
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tool works even if storage directory doesn't exist
- [ ] Provides clear error messages for permission issues
- [ ] Skips corrupted tasks with warning, continues processing others
- [ ] Uses sensible defaults for missing data fields
- [ ] Handles various timestamp formats gracefully
- [ ] Performs well with 100+ tasks
- [ ] Logs appropriate debug information without exposing sensitive data

### Error Scenarios to Test

- Storage directory doesn't exist
- No read permissions on storage directory
- Corrupted JSON files
- Missing ui_messages.json or api_conversation_history.json
- Empty task directories
- Invalid UUID directory names
- Very large task files
- Network storage latency
