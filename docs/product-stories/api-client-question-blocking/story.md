# API Client Question Blocking

## Story Overview

**Title**: Fix API Question Blocking - Make ask_followup_question Tool Block Properly

**Priority**: High

**Story Points**: 8

**Epic**: API Client Improvements

## Problem Statement

When using the API client, the `ask_followup_question` tool does not properly block execution waiting for user responses. This causes tasks to complete prematurely without actual user interaction, breaking the interactive nature of the AI assistant.

## User Story

**As a** developer using the API client to interact with the AI agent
**I want** the `ask_followup_question` tool to pause execution and wait for my response
**So that** I can provide input to guide the AI's decision-making process

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have

- [ ] `ask_followup_question` tool blocks execution until user responds via API
- [ ] User responses are properly captured and processed by the AI
- [ ] VSCode extension question flow remains unchanged
- [ ] All question types work consistently (askQuestion, askConfirmation, askInput)
- [ ] API endpoints handle question submissions correctly
- [ ] SSE events are emitted for question presentation

### Should Have

- [ ] Proper timeout handling for unanswered questions
- [ ] Clear error messages for debugging question issues
- [ ] Question state persistence across API restarts
- [ ] Concurrent question handling for multiple jobs

### Could Have

- [ ] Question history tracking
- [ ] Analytics on question response times
- [ ] Advanced question formatting options

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Changes

- Modify `TaskMessaging.ask()` to delegate to userInterface when available
- Update Task constructor to pass userInterface to TaskMessaging
- Ensure SSEOutputAdapter implements standard question interface

### API Integration

- Verify question submission endpoints work correctly
- Ensure SSE events are properly emitted for questions
- Test question cancellation scenarios

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for TaskMessaging delegation
- Integration tests for API question flow
- End-to-end tests for complete question-answer cycle
- Performance tests for question handling

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature implemented and tested
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Technical documentation complete
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Manual testing completed successfully

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Medium**: Integration between Task messaging and SSEOutputAdapter
- **Low**: Backward compatibility with VSCode extension
- **Low**: Performance impact of question handling

### Business Risks

- **High**: Without fix, API client is not truly interactive
- **Medium**: User frustration with non-blocking questions

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive testing of both API and VSCode modes
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Clear error handling and debugging information

## Dependencies

### Blocked By

- None

### Blocks

- Other API client interactive features
- User experience improvements
- API client adoption

## Implementation Notes

### Recommended Approach

Use **Option 1** from the technical analysis: Delegate Task.ask() to UserInterface

### Key Implementation Points

1. **TaskMessaging.ask()** should detect userInterface and delegate appropriately
2. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing VSCode flows
3. **Standardize question interface** between different modes
4. **Add proper error handling** for API-specific scenarios

### Testing Strategy

- Test both API and VSCode modes independently
- Test question timeout scenarios
- Test question cancellation
- Test concurrent question handling

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics

- 100% of question types block properly in API mode
- 0% regression in VSCode extension question handling
- <2 second response time for question presentation via SSE

### User Experience Metrics

- User satisfaction with interactive API sessions
- Reduced support tickets related to question handling
- Increased API client adoption rates

## Timeline

- **Implementation**: 6-9 days
- **Testing**: 2-3 days
- **Documentation**: 1 day
- **Review & Deployment**: 1-2 days

**Total**: 10-15 days from start to production deployment
