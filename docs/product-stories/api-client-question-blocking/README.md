# API Client Question Blocking Fix

## Overview

Fix the issue where the API client doesn't properly wait for user responses when the LLM asks questions or provides choices, making it appear that the LLM continues execution without waiting.

## Problem Statement

Currently, when using the API client with streaming mode, if the LLM asks a question using `ask_followup_question`, the question appears in the output but the LLM appears to continue processing without waiting for the user's response. This creates a poor user experience and makes interactive workflows unusable.

## Root Cause

The issue has two components:

1. **Client-side**: The API client handles questions asynchronously while continuing to process SSE events, giving the impression that the LLM isn't waiting
2. **Server-side**: Questions may be failing silently and falling back to default answers due to various issues (network, timing, etc.)

## User Stories

### Story 1: Diagnostic Enhancement

**As a developer**, I want comprehensive logging of the question lifecycle so I can identify where and why questions are failing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Question creation, emission, and resolution are logged with timestamps
- Client answer submission success/failure is tracked
- Server-side question failures include detailed error reasons
- Question manager state changes are logged

### Story 2: Client Stream Pausing

**As a user**, I want the API client to pause and wait for my response when the LLM asks a question, so I have a clear interactive experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- SSE stream processing pauses when `question_ask` event is received
- Only the question is displayed until user responds
- Stream processing resumes after answer is submitted
- Error handling for failed answer submissions
- Retry logic for network issues

### Story 3: Fallback Configuration

**As a system administrator**, I want to configure the fallback behavior for failed questions so I can control how the system handles question failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Configurable option to enable/disable automatic fallbacks
- Configurable timeout before fallback occurs
- Clear warnings when fallbacks are triggered
- Option to fail fast instead of using defaults

### Story 4: Enhanced Error Handling

**As a user**, I want clear feedback when question submission fails so I can retry or understand what went wrong.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Clear error messages for failed answer submissions
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Manual retry option for persistent failures
- Graceful degradation when question system is unavailable

## Technical Requirements

### Client-Side Changes

1. Implement stream pausing mechanism during questions
2. Add robust error handling for answer submission
3. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
4. Add success/failure tracking and logging

### Server-Side Changes

1. Add comprehensive question lifecycle logging
2. Make fallback behavior configurable
3. Add question failure reason categorization
4. Add timeout warnings before fallbacks

### Configuration Options

1. `enableQuestionFallback` - Enable/disable automatic fallbacks
2. `questionFallbackTimeout` - Timeout before fallback (if enabled)
3. `questionRetryAttempts` - Number of retry attempts for failed submissions
4. `questionRetryDelay` - Base delay for exponential backoff

## Success Metrics

1. **Question Success Rate**: >95% of questions should be answered successfully
2. **User Experience**: Users should see only the question until they respond
3. **Error Visibility**: Failed questions should be clearly logged and reported
4. **Fallback Transparency**: When fallbacks occur, they should be clearly indicated

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Question manager edge cases and error conditions
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end question flow with various failure scenarios
3. **Network Tests**: Simulate network failures and recovery
4. **Load Tests**: Multiple concurrent questions and high-frequency scenarios
5. **Manual Tests**: Real user interaction with various question types

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Diagnostics (1-2 days)

- Add comprehensive logging
- Identify current failure patterns
- Create monitoring dashboard

### Phase 2: Client Fix (2-3 days)

- Implement stream pausing
- Add error handling and retries
- Test with various question types

### Phase 3: Server Enhancement (1-2 days)

- Make fallback configurable
- Add timeout warnings
- Improve error categorization

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (2-3 days)

- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation updates
- Performance optimization

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- Requires coordination between client and server changes
- May need API versioning for configuration options

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Breaking existing question functionality
**Mitigation**: Feature flags and backward compatibility

**Risk**: Performance impact from stream pausing
**Mitigation**: Efficient pause/resume mechanism with minimal overhead

**Risk**: Complex error scenarios
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and fallback strategies
