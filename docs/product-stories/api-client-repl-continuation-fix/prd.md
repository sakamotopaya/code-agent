# API Client REPL Continuation Fix - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

The API client's REPL mode exits after executing a single task instead of returning to the prompt, breaking the interactive experience and forcing users to restart the client for each command.

## User Story

As a developer using the API client in REPL mode, I want the client to return to the prompt after executing a command so that I can continue working interactively without having to restart the client.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **REPL Continuation**: After executing a task command in REPL mode, the client should return to the interactive prompt
2. **Multiple Commands**: Users should be able to execute multiple commands in sequence without restarting the client
3. **Existing Functionality**: All existing REPL commands (exit, quit, newtask, help, history) should continue to work as expected
4. **Error Handling**: If a command fails, the REPL should still continue and prompt for the next command

## Technical Requirements

- Fix the `handleInput` method in `REPLSession` class to continue the REPL loop after command execution
- Ensure the fix doesn't break existing functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility with non-REPL usage

## Success Metrics

- REPL mode successfully continues after task execution
- Users can execute multiple commands in a single session
- No regression in existing REPL functionality

## Priority

**High** - This is a critical functionality issue that severely impacts usability of the REPL mode

## Effort Estimate

**Small** - Single line code change with clear implementation path

## Dependencies

None - this is a self-contained fix within the api-client.ts file

## Test Requirements

- Manual testing of REPL mode with multiple commands
- Verification that existing REPL commands still work
- Confirmation that non-REPL usage is unaffected
