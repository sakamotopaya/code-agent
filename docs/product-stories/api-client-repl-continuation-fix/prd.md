# API Client REPL Continuation Fix - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The API client's REPL mode is currently broken - it exits after completing a request instead of prompting for the next input. This breaks the continuous conversation flow that users expect from a REPL interface.

## Problem Statement

Users who run `api-client --repl --stream` expect to have a continuous interactive session where they can:

1. Execute a command
2. See the response
3. Immediately be prompted for the next command
4. Continue this loop indefinitely until they type `exit`

Currently, the REPL exits after the first command completes, forcing users to restart the client for each command.

## User Impact

- **Broken User Experience**: Users cannot have continuous conversations with the agent
- **Reduced Productivity**: Users must restart the client after each command
- **Inconsistent Behavior**: The REPL doesn't behave like standard REPL interfaces
- **Development Friction**: Developers testing the API client lose efficiency

## Success Criteria

1. **Continuous Operation**: REPL should continue prompting for input after each command completion
2. **No Duplicate Prompts**: Should not show multiple prompts or exhibit race conditions
3. **Proper Exit Handling**: Should only exit when user explicitly types `exit` or `quit`
4. **Stable Operation**: Should handle multiple consecutive commands without issues

## Technical Requirements

1. **Fix Duplicate Calls**: Remove the duplicate `this.promptUser()` call causing the race condition
2. **Maintain Single Loop**: Ensure REPL loop is controlled by a single mechanism
3. **Preserve Existing Features**: All current REPL features (history, commands, etc.) must continue working
4. **Error Handling**: Errors during command execution should not break the REPL loop

## Implementation Approach

1. **Identify Duplicate Calls**: Located in `REPLSession.handleInput()` method
2. **Remove Duplicate**: Remove the extra `this.promptUser()` call at the end of `handleInput()`
3. **Validate Loop**: Ensure the callback in `promptUser()` maintains the loop correctly
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify continuous operation across multiple commands

## Testing Strategy

1. **Manual Testing**: Run `api-client --repl --stream` and execute multiple commands
2. **Automated Testing**: Create unit tests for the REPL session flow
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Test error scenarios, long commands, and special commands
4. **Integration Testing**: Verify REPL works with all existing features

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] REPL continues after completing each command
- [ ] No duplicate prompts or race conditions
- [ ] All existing REPL commands work correctly
- [ ] History service continues to function
- [ ] Error handling doesn't break the loop
- [ ] Exit commands work as expected

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: This is a targeted fix that removes problematic code without adding new complexity.

**Mitigation**: Thorough testing across all REPL scenarios to ensure no regression.

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- Requires coordination with existing REPL features
- Must maintain backward compatibility

## Timeline

**Story 1**: Fix REPL continuation issue (1 day)

- Immediate fix can be implemented and tested

## Success Metrics

- REPL sessions can execute multiple commands without exiting
- No user reports of premature REPL termination
- Improved developer experience metrics
