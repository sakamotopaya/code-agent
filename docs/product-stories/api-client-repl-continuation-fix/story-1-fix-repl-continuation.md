# Story 1: Fix REPL Continuation After Task Execution

## Story Description

Fix the API client REPL mode so it continues to prompt for input after executing a task command, instead of exiting the session.

## Technical Details

### Problem

The `handleInput` method in `REPLSession` class executes a command but doesn't call `this.promptUser()` again to continue the REPL loop, causing the session to exit.

### Solution

Add a call to `this.promptUser()` at the end of the `handleInput` method to continue the REPL loop after command execution.

### Implementation

**File:** `src/tools/api-client.ts`
**Method:** `REPLSession.handleInput()`
**Location:** After line 736 (after `await this.executeCommand(input)`)

**Code Change:**

```typescript
// Execute the command
await this.executeCommand(input)

// Continue REPL loop after command execution
this.promptUser()
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] REPL returns to prompt after executing any task command
- [ ] Multiple commands can be executed in sequence
- [ ] Special commands (exit, quit, newtask, help, history) continue to work
- [ ] Non-REPL usage remains unaffected
- [ ] Error handling doesn't break the REPL loop

### Test Plan

1. **Basic Continuation Test**

    - Start API client: `npm run api-client -- --repl`
    - Execute a simple task command
    - Verify prompt returns for next command

2. **Multiple Commands Test**

    - Execute several task commands in sequence
    - Verify each command executes and returns to prompt

3. **Special Commands Test**

    - Test `help`, `history`, `newtask` commands
    - Verify they work and return to prompt

4. **Error Handling Test**

    - Execute a command that causes an error
    - Verify REPL continues and prompts for next command

5. **Exit Commands Test**
    - Verify `exit` and `quit` commands still terminate the session properly

### Definition of Done

- Code change implemented in `src/tools/api-client.ts`
- Manual testing confirms REPL continues after task execution
- All existing REPL functionality works as expected
- No regressions in non-REPL usage

### Notes

This is a minimal, surgical fix that addresses the immediate issue without changing the overall architecture or adding complexity. The fix ensures backward compatibility and maintains all existing functionality.
