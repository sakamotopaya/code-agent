# SSE Stream Closing Fix - Product Stories

## Epic: Fix SSE Stream Premature Closure Race Condition

**Problem**: The SSE streaming endpoint has a race condition where the client closes the stream before the server finishes sending completion events, resulting in lost final messages.

**Solution**: Implement server-controlled stream closure with proper signaling protocol.

## Stories

### Story 1: Add Stream End Event Type

**As a** developer  
**I want** a new SSE event type to signal stream termination  
**So that** the client knows when it's safe to close the connection

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Add `STREAM_END` event type to SSE_EVENTS enum
- [ ] Update TypeScript types for new event
- [ ] Add documentation for new event type
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing events

**Technical Tasks**:

- Update `src/api/streaming/types.ts` with new event type
- Update SSE event interfaces
- Add JSDoc documentation

---

### Story 2: Implement Server-Controlled Stream Closure

**As a** API server  
**I want** to control when SSE streams are closed  
**So that** all completion events are sent before stream termination

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] SSEOutputAdapter queues completion events properly
- [ ] Stream closure is delayed until all events are sent
- [ ] `stream_end` event is sent before actual closure
- [ ] No completion events are lost
- [ ] Stream resources are properly cleaned up

**Technical Tasks**:

- Modify `SSEOutputAdapter.emitCompletion()` method
- Add completion event queuing mechanism
- Implement delayed stream closure with `stream_end` event
- Update StreamManager to handle graceful closure

---

### Story 3: Update Client Stream Handling

**As a** API client  
**I want** to wait for server signal before closing streams  
**So that** I receive all completion content without race conditions

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Client waits for `stream_end` event before closing
- [ ] Completion events are processed without immediate closure
- [ ] Timeout fallback prevents hanging connections
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing server versions
- [ ] All completion content is displayed to user

**Technical Tasks**:

- Remove immediate `res.destroy()` calls from completion handlers
- Add `stream_end` event handler
- Implement timeout fallback mechanism
- Update event processing logic

---

### Story 4: Add Stream Lifecycle Monitoring

**As a** system administrator  
**I want** visibility into stream lifecycle events  
**So that** I can monitor for resource leaks and performance issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Log stream creation, completion, and closure events
- [ ] Track stream duration and event counts
- [ ] Monitor for orphaned or leaked streams
- [ ] Alert on abnormal stream behavior
- [ ] Provide metrics for stream performance

**Technical Tasks**:

- Add comprehensive logging to StreamManager
- Implement stream metrics collection
- Add health check for stream resources
- Create monitoring dashboard queries

---

### Story 5: Implement Backward Compatibility

**As a** system operator  
**I want** the new stream closure to work with existing clients  
**So that** deployment doesn't break current integrations

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Old clients continue to work without changes
- [ ] New clients benefit from improved stream handling
- [ ] Gradual migration path for client updates
- [ ] Feature flag to control new behavior
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API

**Technical Tasks**:

- Add feature flag for new stream closure behavior
- Implement dual-mode stream handling
- Create migration guide for client updates
- Add version detection for client capabilities

---

### Story 6: Add Comprehensive Testing

**As a** developer  
**I want** thorough tests for stream closure scenarios  
**So that** the fix is reliable and doesn't introduce regressions

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Unit tests for SSEOutputAdapter completion handling
- [ ] Integration tests for full request/response cycles
- [ ] Load tests for multiple concurrent streams
- [ ] Race condition reproduction and fix validation
- [ ] Backward compatibility test suite

**Technical Tasks**:

- Create unit tests for new completion flow
- Add integration tests for stream lifecycle
- Implement load testing for stream management
- Create regression test for original race condition
- Add backward compatibility test matrix

## Implementation Order

1. **Story 1** - Add Stream End Event Type (Foundation)
2. **Story 2** - Implement Server-Controlled Stream Closure (Core Fix)
3. **Story 4** - Add Stream Lifecycle Monitoring (Observability)
4. **Story 3** - Update Client Stream Handling (Client Fix)
5. **Story 5** - Implement Backward Compatibility (Safety)
6. **Story 6** - Add Comprehensive Testing (Validation)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero lost completion messages in production
- [ ] No increase in stream resource usage
- [ ] Maintained or improved response times
- [ ] Successful backward compatibility
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

## Rollout Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy server changes with feature flag disabled
2. **Phase 2**: Enable feature flag for internal testing
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual rollout to production traffic
4. **Phase 4**: Update client implementations
5. **Phase 5**: Remove feature flag and old code paths
