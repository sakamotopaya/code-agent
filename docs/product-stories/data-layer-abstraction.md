# Data Layer Abstraction for External Application Integration

**Status**: Planning  
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: External Integration  
**Created**: December 16, 2025

## Overview

This epic enables code-agent to integrate with external applications while maintaining full backwards compatibility. The solution creates a **Data Access Layer (DAL)** that abstracts all data operations, enabling code-agent to work with both its native data layer and external application data layers via minimal read/write adapters.

## Business Context

Code-agent needs to be integrated as a dependency into another application that has its own data layer for system prompts, providers, context, history, etc. The integration must:

1. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**: Existing VSCode extension, CLI, and API functionality must continue working unchanged
2. **Support Dual Deployment**: Work as both NPM package and separate executable process
3. **Enable Clean Integration**: Provide minimal interface for external applications to integrate
4. **Ensure Security**: Restrict access to workspace root path only when running as separate process
