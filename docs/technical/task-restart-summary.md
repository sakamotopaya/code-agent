# Task Restart Implementation - Executive Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive plan for implementing task restart functionality in the Code Agent API client, enabling cross-context task continuation across VSCode Extension, CLI, and API interfaces.

## Problem Statement

Currently, when tasks are completed or interrupted in the VSCode extension, users cannot continue them through the API client. This breaks workflow continuity and forces users to start over, losing valuable context and progress.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **API Client Enhancement** (`api-client.js`)

    - Add `--task <taskId>` parameter support
    - Include restart information in API requests
    - Provide clear usage examples and error handling

2. **Unified Task Service** (`src/shared/services/UnifiedTaskService.ts`)

    - Cross-context task discovery and loading
    - Task data reconstruction from storage files
    - Origin context detection and metadata extraction

3. **API Server Integration** (`src/api/server/FastifyServer.ts`)

    - Task restart detection and routing
    - Existing task loading and continuation logic
    - Enhanced error handling and validation

4. **Task Engine Enhancement** (`src/core/task/Task.ts`)
    - Improved `resumePausedTask()` method
    - Cross-context state restoration
    - Conversation history preservation

## Key Features

### Cross-Context Compatibility

- Tasks created in VSCode Extension can be restarted via API
- Tasks created in CLI can be restarted via API
- Tasks created in API can be restarted via API
- Unified storage access across all contexts

### State Preservation

- Complete conversation history restoration
- Mode and configuration preservation
- Workspace context maintenance
- Tool usage history continuity

### User Experience

- Simple `--task <taskId>` parameter
- Clear task ID communication in responses
- Helpful error messages and recovery suggestions
- Restart command examples in completion messages

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Stories 1-3)

- API client parameter parsing
- Task loading infrastructure
- Request routing and detection

### Phase 2: Task Restoration (Stories 4-6)

- State restoration logic
- Conversation continuation
- Task ID communication

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Stories 7-8)

- Cross-context task discovery
- Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Stories 9-10)

- Security and configuration
- Testing and documentation

## Technical Highlights

### Storage Structure

```
globalStoragePath/tasks/{taskId}/
├── api_conversation_history.json  # API messages with timestamps
├── ui_messages.json              # UI display messages
└── task_metadata.json           # Additional metadata
```

### API Usage Examples

```bash
# Start new task
node api-client.js --stream "Create a todo app"
# Response includes: Task ID: abc123-def456-ghi789

# Restart existing task
node api-client.js --stream --task abc123-def456-ghi789 "Add user authentication"
```

### Request Flow

1. Client sends restart request with `taskId` and `restartTask: true`
2. Server validates task ID and loads task data
3. UnifiedTaskService reconstructs task state from storage
4. Task instance is created with existing history
5. New user message is added and task continues
6. Responses stream back with task ID for future restarts

## Benefits

### For Users

- **Workflow Continuity**: Pick up where you left off across interfaces
- **Context Preservation**: No loss of conversation history or progress
- **Flexibility**: Use the best tool for each part of your workflow
- **Efficiency**: Avoid repeating context and instructions

### For Developers

- **Unified Architecture**: Consistent task handling across all contexts
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new contexts or features
- **Robust Error Handling**: Clear diagnostics and recovery paths
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full coverage of restart scenarios

## Risk Mitigation

### Security

- Task ID validation prevents directory traversal
- Access control ensures users only access their tasks
- Path sanitization prevents malicious file access
- Audit logging for security monitoring

### Performance

- Lazy loading of task data
- Streaming file operations for large histories
- Task metadata caching for quick lookups
- Resource bounds to prevent memory issues

### Reliability

- Graceful handling of corrupted task data
- Fallback mechanisms for missing files
- Comprehensive error messages with recovery suggestions
- Extensive testing across all failure scenarios

## Success Metrics

- **Functionality**: 95%+ task restart success rate
- **Performance**: <2 second task loading time
- **Usability**: Clear task ID visibility and restart instructions
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss during task transitions
- **Security**: No unauthorized task access incidents

## Documentation Deliverables

1. **Technical Implementation Plan** (`task-restart-implementation.md`)

    - Detailed technical specifications
    - Code examples and interfaces
    - Integration requirements

2. **Product Stories** (`task-restart-stories.md`)
