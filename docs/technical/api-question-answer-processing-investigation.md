# API Question Answer Processing Investigation

## Status: NEXT PHASE

_After successful resolution of unified question manager initialization_

## Issue Description

With the primary unified question manager initialization issue resolved, there is now a secondary issue in the answer processing phase where the SSE stream gets destroyed during answer submission.

## Evidence from Logs

### Successful Question Flow

```
[TASK-DEBUG] Using explicit API mode with outputAdapter
[TASK-DEBUG] Detected question system mode: api
[TASK-DEBUG] Unified question manager initialized successfully for mode: api
QUESTION_EVENT: {"type":"question","questionId":"q_job_md26d8t1_1c18e960_1752441423975_2"...}
```

### Issue During Answer Processing

```
[ERROR] Stream response already destroyed for job job_md26d8t1_1c18e960
[INFO] Closed SSE stream for job job_md26d8t1_1c18e960
[INFO] Cancelling execution job_md26d8t1_1c18e960: Client disconnected
```

## Analysis

### What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **Question Generation**: Questions are created and formatted correctly
2. **SSE Delivery**: Questions reach the client via server-sent events
3. **Client Interaction**: User can see and interact with question interface
4. **Answer Capture**: User selections are captured by the client

### What Needs Investigation üîç

1. **Answer Submission Timing**: When does the stream get destroyed relative to answer submission?
2. **Stream Lifecycle**: How should the stream be managed during question/answer cycles?
3. **Client-Server Coordination**: What triggers the premature stream closure?

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Answer Submission Race Condition

The client may be submitting answers in a way that triggers stream closure before the server can process them.

### 2. Stream Timeout Issues

The question/answer cycle may be taking longer than expected timeouts.

### 3. Client Disconnect Handling

The client might be disconnecting prematurely after submitting answers.

### 4. Server-Side Stream Management

The server may be incorrectly closing streams during normal question/answer flow.

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Answer Submission Flow Analysis

1. **Trace answer submission path** from client to server
2. **Examine timing** of stream destruction relative to answer events
3. **Review stream lifecycle** during question/answer cycles

### Phase 2: Client-Server Coordination

1. **Analyze client-side** answer submission implementation
2. **Review server-side** answer processing logic
3. **Identify coordination** gaps or race conditions

### Phase 3: Stream Management

1. **Review SSE stream** lifecycle management
2. **Examine timeout handling** during interactive operations
3. **Analyze cleanup logic** for question/answer cycles

## Success Metrics

- [ ] User can complete full question/answer cycle without stream destruction
- [ ] Server receives and processes answers correctly
- [ ] Stream remains active throughout interaction
- [ ] Task continues after receiving answer
