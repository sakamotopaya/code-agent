# API Server Compilation Issue Discovery

## Issue Summary

The API server was running **old compiled JavaScript** instead of the updated TypeScript source code containing the unified question manager fixes.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem

- Docker container runs compiled JS from `src/dist/api/api-entry.js`
- Container was built before TypeScript changes were made
- Source code is mounted as volume, but container executes pre-compiled JavaScript
- Enhanced logging and `runtimeMode: 'api'` fix not present in running code

### Evidence

1. **Missing Enhanced Logging**: None of the enhanced debug logs appeared in API logs
2. **Container Build Process**: Dockerfile runs `pnpm bundle` during build (line 100)
3. **Execution Command**: Container runs `node dist/api/api-entry.js` (line 142)
4. **Source Mounting**: Docker Compose mounts source as volume but doesn't recompile

### Container Architecture

```
Docker Container:
├── /app/src/              <- Mounted from host (live TypeScript changes)
├── /app/src/dist/         <- Pre-compiled JavaScript (OLD)
└── CMD: node dist/api/api-entry.js  <- Runs old compiled code
```

## Resolution Plan

### Step 1: Rebuild Container

```bash
cd docker/development
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache roo-api-dev
docker-compose up -d roo-api-dev
```

### Step 2: Verify Fix

1. Check logs for enhanced logging messages
2. Test question/answer flow
3. Verify `runtimeMode: 'api'` parameter is passed correctly

### Step 3: Alternative Local Testing

If Docker rebuild is complex, test locally:

```bash
./run-api.sh --build-only  # Rebuilds TypeScript to JavaScript
./run-api.sh               # Runs with fresh compiled code
```

## Key Learning

**Development with Docker**: When TypeScript source is mounted as volume but container runs compiled JavaScript, always rebuild container after TypeScript changes to ensure compiled code is updated.

## Files Modified (Need Recompilation)

- `src/api/server/FastifyServer.ts` - Added `runtimeMode: 'api'` parameter
- `src/core/tools/askFollowupQuestionTool.ts` - Added enhanced error logging
- Other TypeScript files with logging improvements

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild Docker container
2. Test unified question manager initialization
3. Verify complete question/answer flow
4. Document successful resolution
