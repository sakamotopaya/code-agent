# Streaming Recovery Analysis

## Problem Root Cause

The issue is that I replaced a working JavaScript `api-client.js` file with a TypeScript version that doesn't work properly. The original JavaScript file had a working `executeStreamingRequest` function that properly handled SSE streaming.

## What Was Lost

- Working JavaScript implementation of streaming client
- Proper SSE event handling
- Real-time response processing
- Error handling for streaming connections

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Restore from Git History

- Find the commit from ~12:30 PM today
- Extract the working JavaScript `api-client.js` file
- Compare with current broken TypeScript version
- Restore the working implementation

### Option 2: Rebuild from Working Pattern

- Identify the exact API endpoint structure (`/execute/stream`)
- Recreate the SSE parsing logic
- Restore the streaming event processing
- Test thoroughly

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

- Keep TypeScript structure but implement working JavaScript logic
- Port the working streaming implementation to TypeScript
- Maintain type safety while restoring functionality

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Find the working code**: Get the original JavaScript implementation
2. **Identify the differences**: Compare working vs broken versions
3. **Restore functionality**: Fix the streaming implementation
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure streaming works in REPL mode

## Key Questions

- Can we access the git commit from 12:30 PM today?
- Does the user have a backup of the working JavaScript file?
- Are there other files that contain the working streaming implementation?

## Success Criteria

- REPL mode shows real-time streaming responses
- No more "ðŸŒŠ Streaming request implementation..." stub message
- All CLI options work correctly
- Streaming handles errors gracefully
