# api-client.js Deep Analysis

## Parameter Handling Analysis

After thoroughly reviewing the `api-client.js` script, I can confirm that **the --stream parameter is NOT being ignored when --mode is passed**. Here's the evidence:

### Argument Parsing (Lines 33-61)

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
	const arg = args[i]

	if (arg === "--stream") {
		useStream = true
	} else if (arg === "--mode") {
		mode = args[++i] || "code"
	}
	// ... other parameters
}
```

**✅ Both parameters are parsed independently and correctly**

### Execution Logic (Lines 662-668)

```javascript
if (useStream) {
	// Test streaming endpoint
	await testStreamingEndpoint()
} else {
	// Test regular execute endpoint
	await testExecuteEndpoint()
}
```

**✅ The script correctly chooses streaming vs non-streaming based on `useStream` flag**

### Streaming Payload (Lines 404-410)

```javascript
const payload = JSON.stringify({
	task,
	mode, // Add mode to payload
	verbose,
	logSystemPrompt,
	logLlm,
})
```

**✅ The mode parameter is correctly included in the streaming request payload**

## What the Script Does Correctly

1. **Parameter Independence**: `--stream` and `--mode` are parsed independently
2. **Correct Routing**: Uses `/execute/stream` when `--stream` is specified
3. **Payload Construction**: Includes both `task` and `mode` in the request
4. **SSE Handling**: Properly handles Server-Sent Events
5. **Completion Handling**: Correctly destroys connection when task completes

## Client Behavior Analysis

The client does call `res.destroy()` when it receives completion events (lines 498, 591), but this is **correct behavior** - the client should close the connection when the task completes.

From the server logs, we see:

```
Closed SSE stream for job job_mct8216h_babf86a0
Cancelled job job_mct8216h_babf86a0: Client disconnected
```

This happens AFTER the task completes, not before. The sequence is:

1. Task starts
2. Task completes immediately (the real problem)
3. Server sends completion event
4. Client receives completion and closes connection
5. Server logs "Client disconnected"

## Conclusion

**The api-client.js script is working correctly.** The issue is NOT with parameter handling or client behavior. The real problem is that the task is completing immediately on the server side without actually executing the LLM.

The 0 token usage in the logs proves the LLM was never called, which means the issue is in the server-side task execution logic, not the client script.

## Next Investigation Steps

Since the client script is correct, we need to focus on:

1. Why the task completes immediately with 0 tokens
2. Whether the issue is specific to custom modes like "ticket-oracle"
3. API configuration problems
4. Task execution flow issues in the server
