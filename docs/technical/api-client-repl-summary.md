# API Client REPL Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This project adds interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) functionality to the existing api-client.js while maintaining full backward compatibility. The REPL enables users to have continuous conversations with the AI agent without restarting the client for each command.

## Key Features

### Core REPL Functionality

- **Interactive Mode**: `--repl` flag starts an interactive session
- **Task Continuity**: Maintains conversation context across multiple commands
- **Special Commands**: Built-in commands for session management
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

### Session Management

- **Automatic Task Tracking**: First command creates a task, subsequent commands continue it
- **Task Reset**: `newtask` command clears current task to start fresh
- **Task Loading**: Can start REPL with existing task via `--repl --task <taskId>`
- **Clean Exit**: `exit` command terminates session gracefully

### User Experience

- **Dynamic Prompts**: Shows current task status in prompt
- **Clear Feedback**: Informative messages about session state
- **Help System**: Built-in help for REPL-specific commands
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of errors without session termination

## Architecture Highlights

### REPLSession Class

Central component managing:

- User input/output via readline interface
- Task ID persistence across commands
- Command routing (special vs API commands)
- Integration with existing API communication layer

### Task Context Flow

```
User Command â†’ Command Parser â†’ Task Context Check â†’ API Request â†’ Response Processing â†’ Update Session State â†’ Display Results â†’ Next Prompt
```

### Integration Strategy

- **Shared Logic**: Reuses existing API request and response handling
- **Modular Design**: REPL functionality is self-contained
- **Configuration Preservation**: All command-line options work in REPL mode

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Add `--repl` flag detection
2. Implement REPLSession class with basic loop
3. Add special command handling (exit, newtask, help)
4. Integrate with existing API communication

### Phase 2: Task Management

1. Implement task ID extraction from API responses
2. Add automatic task continuation logic
3. Support starting REPL with existing task
4. Add session state management

### Phase 3: Enhanced UX

1. Dynamic prompts showing task status
2. Comprehensive help system
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Command history and tab completion

## Technical Benefits

### For Users

- **Continuous Conversations**: No need to restart client between commands
- **Context Preservation**: AI maintains full conversation history
- **Flexible Workflow**: Can switch between tasks or start fresh as needed
- **Familiar Interface**: Standard REPL conventions (exit, help, etc.)

### For Developers

- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing scripts and workflows unaffected
- **Reusable Components**: REPL logic can be adapted for other contexts
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear separation between REPL and API logic
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new REPL commands or features

## Usage Examples

### Basic REPL Session

```bash
# Start interactive session
node api-client.js --repl --stream

# Session output:
ðŸš€ Roo API Client REPL Mode
Commands: exit (quit), newtask (clear task), help (show help)
ðŸ’¡ First command will create a new task

roo-api [new] > create a simple todo app
# ... AI response with task creation ...

roo-api [a1b2c3d4...] > add user authentication
# ... AI continues the same task ...

roo-api [a1b2c3d4...] > newtask
ðŸ”„ Task cleared - next command will start a new task

roo-api [new] > exit
ðŸ‘‹ Goodbye!
```

### Starting with Existing Task

```bash
# Continue previous task in REPL mode
node api-client.js --repl --stream --task a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890

# Session output:
ðŸš€ Roo API Client REPL Mode
ðŸ“‹ Continuing task: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
ðŸ’¡ Commands will continue the existing conversation

roo-api [a1b2c3d4...] > what did we work on last time?
# ... AI recalls previous conversation ...
```

## File Organization

### New Files Created

- `docs/product-stories/api-client-repl-stories.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
- `docs/technical/api-client-repl-implementation.md` - Detailed implementation guide
- `docs/technical/api-client-repl-architecture.md` - System architecture and design
- `docs/technical/api-client-repl-summary.md` - This summary document

### Modified Files

## Next Steps

### Implementation Priority

1. **Core REPL Loop** - Basic interactive functionality
2. **Task Management** - Session state and task continuity
3. **User Experience** - Prompts, help, and error handling
4. **Testing** - Unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation** - Usage examples and help updates

### Success Criteria

- [ ] REPL mode works with both streaming and basic API modes
- [ ] Task context is preserved across multiple commands
- [ ] Special commands (exit, newtask, help) function correctly
- [ ] Can start REPL with existing task via --task parameter
- [ ] All existing command-line functionality remains unchanged
- [ ] Error handling prevents session crashes
- [ ] User experience is intuitive and helpful

## Risk Mitigation

### Backward Compatibility

- Extensive testing of existing functionality
- REPL mode is opt-in via explicit flag
- No changes to existing API contracts

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- Session continues even after individual command errors
- Clear error messages guide user recovery

### Performance

- Minimal memory overhead for session state
- Reuse of existing API communication infrastructure
- Efficient handling of long-running sessions

## Conclusion

The REPL implementation enhances the api-client.js with interactive capabilities while maintaining the robustness and flexibility of the existing system. The modular design ensures easy maintenance and future extensibility, while the user-centric approach provides an intuitive and powerful interface for continuous AI interactions.

The implementation follows established patterns from the existing codebase and leverages the robust task management system already in place, ensuring a seamless integration that enhances rather than disrupts the current workflow.
