# Docker WASM Fix Verification

## Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented the environment variable override solution to fix the Docker WASM path issue. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Code Changes

**File**: `src/services/tree-sitter/languageParser.ts`

- Added `getWasmDirectory()` function that checks for `TREE_SITTER_WASM_DIR` environment variable
- Enhanced context detection to handle API context (`/api` directory)
- Added validation to ensure WASM directory contains required files
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Updated both `loadLanguage()` and `initializeParser()` functions

### 2. Docker Configuration Updates

**Files Updated**:

- `docker/development/Dockerfile` - Added `TREE_SITTER_WASM_DIR=/app/src/dist`
- `docker/production/Dockerfile` - Added `TREE_SITTER_WASM_DIR=/app/src/dist`
- `docker/development/docker-compose.yml` - Added environment variable for both dev and test services
- `docker/production/docker-compose.yml` - Added environment variable

### 3. Testing and Documentation

**Files Created**:

- `src/services/tree-sitter/__tests__/wasmDirectoryResolution.test.ts` - Unit tests for WASM directory resolution
- `docs/configuration/tree-sitter-wasm-configuration.md` - Comprehensive configuration documentation
- `docs/technical/docker-wasm-path-issue-analysis.md` - Technical analysis of the issue
- `docs/product-stories/api/docker-wasm-path-fix.md` - Product stories for the implementation

## How the Fix Works

### Before the Fix

```
Docker API runs from: /app/src/dist/api/
Looks for WASM files in: /app/src/dist/api/ (❌ Wrong!)
Actual WASM files location: /app/src/dist/
Result: ENOENT error - files not found
```

### After the Fix

```
Docker API runs from: /app/src/dist/api/
Environment variable set: TREE_SITTER_WASM_DIR=/app/src/dist
Looks for WASM files in: /app/src/dist/ (✅ Correct!)
Actual WASM files location: /app/src/dist/
Result: WASM files found and loaded successfully
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Build Verification

✅ **PASSED**: Build completed successfully with WASM files copied to correct location:

```
[copyWasms] Copied tree-sitter.wasm to /Users/eo/code/code-agent/src/dist
[copyWasms] Copied 35 tree-sitter language wasms to /Users/eo/code/code-agent/src/dist
```

### 2. Code Quality

✅ **PASSED**:

- TypeScript compilation successful
- No linting errors
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Comprehensive error handling added

### 3. Docker Configuration

✅ **PASSED**: Environment variable added to all Docker configurations:

- Development Dockerfile
- Production Dockerfile
- Development docker-compose.yml
- Production docker-compose.yml

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### 1. Environment Variable Override

When `TREE_SITTER_WASM_DIR` is set:

```bash
[tree-sitter] Using WASM directory from environment: /app/src/dist
[tree-sitter] Loading language javascript from /app/src/dist/tree-sitter-javascript.wasm
[tree-sitter] Initializing parser with WASM directory: /app/src/dist
[tree-sitter] Parser initialized successfully
```

### 2. Enhanced Context Detection

When environment variable is not set, improved fallback logic:

```bash
[tree-sitter] Using WASM directory from context detection: /app/src/dist
```

### 3. Error Handling

If invalid directory is specified:

```bash
Error: TREE_SITTER_WASM_DIR points to invalid directory: /invalid/path. tree-sitter.wasm not found.
```

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing in Docker

1. **Build and run development container**:

    ```bash
    cd docker/development
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. **Check logs for successful WASM loading**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs roo-api-dev | grep tree-sitter
    ```

3. **Test API endpoint that uses tree-sitter**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/parse-code \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"code": "function test() { return 42; }", "language": "javascript"}'
    ```

### Automated Testing

Run the unit tests:

```bash
cd src
npm test -- --testPathPattern=wasmDirectoryResolution.test.ts
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the fix can be easily rolled back:

1. **Remove environment variable** from Docker configurations
2. **Revert languageParser.ts** to use only the original context detection
3. **Rebuild containers** without the environment variable

The fix is designed to be backward compatible, so existing deployments will continue to work.

## Future Improvements

This fix addresses the immediate Docker issue, but future improvements could include:

1. **Story 3**: Replace hardcoded context detection with intelligent directory traversal
2. **Story 4**: Add comprehensive integration tests for all execution contexts
3. **Story 5**: Implement configuration management system for asset paths

## Conclusion

The environment variable override solution provides:

- ✅ **Quick fix** for the immediate Docker WASM path issue
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** with existing deployments
- ✅ **Explicit configuration** following 12-factor app principles
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** for debugging
- ✅ **Proper error handling** with clear error messages
- ✅ **Documentation** for future maintenance

The Docker API should now start successfully and tree-sitter functionality should work correctly in containerized environments.
