## when i run this command:

```sh
eo@m3x code-agent % ./test-api.js --stream "throughly review this ticket and all related tickets. Note what remains to ship to JAM: 089162/429275" --mode ticket-oracle
```

## I get this output

I'll thoroughly review ticket 089162/429275 and all related tickets to determine what remains to ship to JAM. Let me start by retrieving the ticket information.

<thinking>
I need to get information about ticket 089162/429275. Looking at the file structure, I see there's an MCP server called "agentx-dpsp" that has a "ticketRetriever" tool. This seems like the appropriate tool to use to get ticket information.

I'll use the MCP tool to retrieve the ticket information first, then analyze what remains to ship to JAM.
</thinking>
<server_name>agentx-dpsp</server_name>
<tool_name>ticketRetriever</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
"ticket": "089162/429275"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>I've retrieved the main ticket information. Now I need to check the related tickets mentioned in the last comment (090533/458 and 090533/1017) to get a complete picture of what remains to ship to JAM.

<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>agentx-dpsp</server_name>
<tool_name>ticketRetriever</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
"ticket": "090533/458"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>Now let me retrieve information about the second related ticket:

<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>agentx-dpsp</server_name>
<tool_name>ticketRetriever</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
"ticket": "090533/1017"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>Let me check if there are any other related tickets mentioned in the original ticket or these related tickets. I'll also look for any ticket report that might have been generated for this ticket.

<read_file>
<args>
<file>
<path>ticket_report_089162_429487.md</path>
</file>
</args>
</read_file>I notice that the ticket report is for a different ticket (089162/429487) than the one we're investigating (089162/429275). Let me check if there are any other files that might contain information about our target ticket.

<search_files>
<path>.</path>
<regex>089162/429275</regex>
</search_files>Let me also check if there's any information about the JAM deployment or shipping requirements in the codebase:

<search*files>
<path>.</path>
<regex>JAM.\_ship</regex>
<file_pattern>*.ts,_.js,_.md</file_pattern>
</search_files>Based on the information I've gathered, I'll now provide a comprehensive analysis of ticket 089162/429275 and related tickets to determine what remains to ship to JAM.

# Ticket Analysis: 089162/429275 and Related Tickets

## Primary Ticket (089162/429275)

- **Customer**: RJames Management Group Ltd
- **Issue**: Customer returned a core (10R6163-CORE) but it's not showing up on their core activity
- **Status**: Dispatched
- **Last Activity**: Eric Oliver referenced related tickets 090533/458 and 090533/1017
- **Root Cause**: There are two operations needed to correct core eligibility for customer views

## Related Ticket 1 (090533/458)

- **Issue**: Cores showing from quotes in customer section in core module under customer account module
- **Fix**: Adjusted core section customer and supplier grids to require an invoice or credit to display (not just quotes or PTs)
- **Status**: Dispatched
- **Last Test Result**: "Core doesn't show up until invoiced, as expected. Core doesn't show as active, under 'Customer Cores', after invoicing, though. Failing it on that."

## Related Ticket 2 (090533/1017)

- **Issue**: Customer core page "Active Only" filter showing incorrect results
- **Fix**:
    - On customer core page, "Active Only" should show invoices where returned qty is less than shipped qty and no RMA is attached
    - On supplier core page, "Active Only" should show cores not in RMA
- **Status**: Dispatched
- **Latest Activity**:
    - May 29, 2025: "Review latest change - JAM QA customer core and supplier core prior entry is now updated - ok."
    - May 29, 2025: "Merged into -220406 and hotpatched to JAM/GLD QA."
    - May 27, 2025: "Supplier core grid will now use the same variable as the customer core grid" (Changeset 38101)
    - May 23, 2025: "Qty rec on the Vendor cores screen will now use same calculation as qty rec on customer cores" (Changeset 38096)

## What Remains to Ship to JAM

1. **Final Verification and Production Deployment**:

    - The fixes have been merged and hotpatched to JAM QA environment (May 29, 2025)
    - The changes appear to be working correctly in QA
    - The final step is to deploy these changes to JAM Production environment

2. **Specific Changes Pending Deployment**:

    - Changeset 38101: Supplier core grid now uses the same variable as the customer core grid
    - Changeset 38096: Qty rec on the Vendor cores screen now uses same calculation as qty rec on customer cores
    - These changes affect three areas: Supplier cores, customer cores, and customer history

3. **Testing Confirmation**:
    - The changes have been verified in JAM QA and GLD QA environments
    - The core activity display issues have been resolved according to the latest testing notes

The ticket indicates that the fixes have been implemented and tested in QA environments, but the final step of deploying to JAM Production remains to be completed.

We want to modify ./test-api.js to filter the incoming output based upon these rules:

- at the end of the output is 'Task completed successfully'. we always want to supress this message
- do not emit the actual response from the api call unless the --show-response arg is passed
- the entire <thinking></thinking> should be reduced to 'Thinking...' in the output unless the --show-thinking arg is passed
- <use_mcp_tool></use_mcp_tool> should be hidden unless --show-mcp-use arg is passed
- tool use should be suppressed unless the --tool_use arg is passed
-
