We are ready to implement story CLI-07 in story plan docs/product-stories/cli-implementation-roadmap.md. Analyze the story doc docs/product-stories/cli-07-command-files-and-stdio.md one more time to make sure it makes sense, nothing is missing, uses SOLID principles and follows modern patterns and practices. update the story document if needed before proceeding to implementation. During implementation keep the main story document (docs/product-stories/cli-implementation-roadmap.md) and the story document (docs/product-stories/cli-07-command-files-and-stdio.md) up to date with status and progress. Be sure and keep track of the date and time the story was started and finished. Once implementation is complete, perform a final review and make sure the story docs reflect the final status and date times completed and closed out.
